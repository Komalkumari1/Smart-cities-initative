Stockholm, Sweden</h1><br><br>
<p>The underpinning of Stockholm's Smart city technology is the Stokab dark fiber system. It was developed in 1994 to provide a fiber-optic network across Stockholm. Private companies can lease fiber as service providers on equal terms.<br><br><br><br><br>
Stockholm seeks to create energy-efficient buildings, to monitor traffic, and to develop e-services. These e-services include political announcements, parking space bookings, and snow removal. GPS analytics will allow residents to plan their travel routes across the city.<br><br><br><br><br>

The main focus for Stockholm as a smart city has been to bring its citizens, government, and other constituent parts together, enabling simple, effective communication, and an open flow of information.<br><br><br><br><br>

One such example is the city’s investment of €70 million in high-quality, accessible e-government services since 2007, which has created over 50 new digital services and cut management costs substantially.<br><br><br><br><br>

 

 

Green IT leads the way<br><br><br><br><br>
Green IT is the collective name for the measures designed to improve our environment with the help of IT. It involves using information technology to reduce negative impact on the environment, as well as lowering the energy consumption and environmental impact of the IT sector as a whole.<br><br><br><br><br>

Environmentally efficient transport<br><br><br><br><br>
The City’s goal is to create a long-term sustainable transport system, based on new technology, non-fossil fuels, and more information.
Non-toxic products and buildings<br><br><br><br><br>
The City shall minimise the dispersal of harmful substances by choosing eco-friendly products and services. Environmentally sustainable methods and materials shall be used during development and construction work.<br><br><br><br><br>
Sustainable energy usage<br><br><br><br><br>
If the greenhouse effect is to be reduced, energy must be used more efficiently and the energy used must come from renewable sources. The use of energy efficient technology will enable the city to be a major player in environmentally driven growth and development, and to reduce its operating costs.<br><br><br><br><br>
Sustainable use of land and water<br><br><br><br><br>
Long-term sustainable usage of land promotes economic development without jeopardising important environmental values.
Environmentally efficient waste management<br><br><br><br><br>
Efficient and eco-friendly waste management is an important part of society’s infrastructure. The City’s goal is to minimise the amount of waste produced and to increase the percentage utilised through re-usage and recycling.<br><br><br><br><br>
A healthy indoor environment<br><br><br><br><br>
The City’s goal is to reduce the number of people who suffer from problems due to their indoor environment, particularly in preschools, schools and housing for the elderly.<br><br><br><br><br>
e-services<br><br><br><br><br>
Efficient public services are key factors in a thriving city and they should be characterised by a common desire to prioritize citizens’ different needs and desires. The city’s responsibility is to provide support and facilitate in everyday life. Applying for permits, schools, elderly care or to plan the commuting rout to work, are just a few examples of popular e-services offered.<br><br><br><br><br>

E-asy<br><br><br><br><br>
Stockholm.se is the meeting place for Stockholm residents. Several exciting services are being developed there. People can read about this development already now, apply for preschool and more. It will also be easier and more attractive to run a business, which will benefit Stockholm’s business community.<br><br><br><br><br>
E-volution<br><br><br><br><br>
inhabitants visit stockholm.se and can pick and choose from the services the City provides. Including the latest political decisions, book a parking space in the city centre or give their opinion on snow clearance
E-xpansive<br><br><br><br><br>
Infrastructural, it should be easy to move freely between the different city districts in Stockholm. Even when someone is sitting in a wheel chair. Therefore, digital cooperation between municipalities, the county council, public authorities and private operators is important. This cooperation makes the services provided by the City both efficient and accessible. They are also developing cooperation in the nursing and health care area and creating a joint website at which guardians and next-of-kin can quickly access the information and services they need.<br><br><br><br><br>
E-fficient<br><br><br><br><br>
The city is providing broadband for all and new services for mobile phones. GPS shows the way with flexible route descriptions and allow people to study future city plans. This is all designed to make Stockholm a more accessible, more attractive and more modern city to live and work in. With new technology a lot of things become easier. For example, applying for a planning permit or a licence to serve alcohol.
One of the world’s most connected cities<br><br><br><br><br>
Stokab leases fibre optic networks that telecom operators, businesses, local authorities and organisations use for digital communications. Leasing agreements are structured on favorable terms to encourage IT development and strong growth in the Stockholm region.<br><br><br><br><br>
In addition to fibre optics, Stokab provides space in nodes/hubs where customers can install communication equipment needed to connect their own networks to others’ networks.<br><br><br><br><br>

It is also exploring ways to make better use of existing traffic monitoring and congestion mechanisms and has implemented a Green IT initiative to reduce environmental impact through the use of IT, as well as to limit the impact of the IT sector itself.

Another program will display the locations and routes of snowplows, while another will allow residents to report potholes, code violations and garbage pickup complaints to authorities.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

The Kista Science City region brings together government, industry, and academia to develop ICT applications for implementation in a Smart city
The city’s wi-fi data network and a new software program called Municity5 will allow building inspectors to file reports and print documents from the field.</p>
