INITIATIVES<br><br>

Since its inception, the Smart Dubai Office has launched over 130 initiatives in partnership with government and private sector entities. Some key initiatives include, the Dubai Data Initiative, the Dubai Blockchain Strategy, the Happiness Agenda, the Dubai AI Roadmap and the Dubai Paperless Strategy.<br><br><br><br>

PAPERLESS<br><br>
We are building a future without paper. In 2021, Dubai government will go completely paper-free, eliminating more than 1 billion pieces of paper used for government transactions every year. Working across government entities, our integrated framework marks another major step towards making Dubai a smart city of the future and improving happiness levels for staff and citizens alike – saving time, resources and the environment.<br><br><br><br>

STRATEGY<br><br>

“DUBAI GOVERNMENT WILL ISSUE ITS LAST PAPER TRANSACTION IN 2021, WE’VE INSTRUCTED SMART DUBAI OFFICE TO OVERSEE THIS GOAL” - His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Al Maktoum during Smart Dubai’s Future Now Event, April 16 2017
As a fully paperless government, 100% of internal processes and customer facing services  will be digitized from 2021. That means government will no longer issue or ask for paper documents across all of its operations.<br><br><br><br>

As part of this transition process, we will focus on implementing the necessary technology to enable paper-free transactions. We will also create an legal framework to address digital procedures and will overcome any cultural and customary barriers in the move away from paper.<br><br><br><br>

By eliminating the 1 billion pieces of paper used by the government each year, we could save enough money to feed 4 million children, prevent 130,000 trees from being cut down, and save 40 hours of productivity to give people more time to spend doing what they love.
We have launched the ‘100% Paperless' Stamp initiative as part of the ‘Government Development Track’ – one of the six tracks announced by the Dubai Council, which was inaugurated at the beginning of 2020 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai.<br><br><br><br>

The ‘Stamp’ is awarded to government entities that have fully implemented the Dubai Paperless Strategy as a symbol reflecting their complete transition into entities that offer digital, paperless services. The initiative recognises entities that made outstanding efforts to implement the strategy, offering their services via fully digital mediums backed by an efficient internal digital infrastructure.<br><br><br><br>

HAPPINESS AGENDA<br><br>
We want to make Dubai the happiest city on earth. As we transform the future of Dubai through smart technology and innovation, we have prioritised happiness as our primary goal. By addressing the fundamental needs of our residents and visitors, we can enhance everybody’s short- and long-term happiness and wellbeing, and create a global benchmark for other cities to follow our lead.<br><br><br><br>

STRATEGY<br><br>
Our strategy for a Smart Dubai has happiness at its core. As the city is transformed, we are using the Happiness Agenda as a one-of-a-kind, scientific and systematic approach to raising and sustaining happiness levels and measuring the impact on our residents and visitors. We hope to discover people’s wants and needs, to inspire positive change, to build awareness and encourage self-reflection, and to predict the impact of happiness by using our city-wide Happiness Index. To help us achieve our goals, our Happiness Champions are a key part of this integrated system to spread happiness through all parts of our society. Leading the implementation of the Happiness Agenda, they are working as ambassadors across a growing range of government- and non-government entities, embedding happiness into the DNA of these organisations. Our ultimate aim is to create a happy, positive experience for all, one that is seamless, safe, personalised, impactful and efficient. <br><br><br><br>
 
BLOCKCHAIN<br><br>
The Dubai Blockchain Strategy will help Dubai achieve the vision of H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum by making "Dubai [will be] the first city fully powered by Blockchain by 2020" and make Dubai the happiest city on earth. The strategy will be using 3 strategic pillars Government Efficiency, Industry Creation, and International Leadership.<br><br><br><br>

STRATEGY<br><br>
Launched by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan, the Dubai Blockchain Strategy, is a result of a collaboration between the Smart Dubai Office and the Dubai Future Foundation to continually explore and evaluate the latest technology innovations that demonstrate an opportunity to deliver more seamless, safe, efficient, and impactful city experiences.<br><br><br><br>

Blockchain technology is a new, powerful tool that is already shaping the future of the Internet with simple, safe and secure transactions. The Dubai Blockchain Strategy will help Dubai achieve the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to create the future of Dubai, and make Dubai the happiest city on earth.<br><br><br><br>

New Wave of Economic Opportunity & Digital Innovation<br><br><br><br>

The Dubai Blockchain strategy will usher in economic opportunity for all sectors in the city, and cement Dubai’s reputation as a global technology leader, in line with Smart Dubai’s mandate to become global leader in the smart economy, fuelling entrepreneurship and global competitiveness.<br><br><br><br>

Dubai has a long tradition of leading digital innovation for the region. Now, for the first time, Dubai will be pioneering the application of new technology for cities, and sharing it with the world. When successful, Dubai will be the first blockchain powered government, driving the future economy.<br><br><br><br>

"Adopting Blockchain technology Dubai stands to unlock 5.5 billion dirham in savings annually in document processing alone — equal to the one Burj Khalifa’s worth of value every year." The Dubai Blockchain Strategy establishes a roadmap for the introduction of Blockchain technology for Dubai and the creation of an open platform to share the technology with cities across the globe. The Dubai Blockchain strategy is built on three pillars of government efficiency, industry creation and international leadership.<br><br><br><br>

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRINCIPLES & ETHICS<br><br><br><br>
AI’s rapid advancement and innovation potential across a range of fields is incredibly exciting. Yet a thorough and open discussion around AI ethics, and the principles organisations using this technology must consider, is urgently needed.<br><br><br><br>

Dubai’s Ethical AI Toolkit has been created to provide practical help across a city ecosystem. It supports industry, academia and individuals in understanding how AI systems can be used responsibly. It consists of principles and guidelines, and a self-assessment tool for developers to assess their platforms.<br><br><br><br>

Our aim is to offer unified guidance that is continuously improved in collaboration with our communities. The eventual goal is to reach widespread agreement and adoption of commonly-agreed policies to inform the ethical use of AI not just in Dubai but around the world.<br><br><br><br>

Our first-of-its-kind Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab is accelerating Dubai towards becoming the smartest city in the world. We are harnessing the power of machine learning to integrate AI into government services and city experiences in order to improve our citizens’ overall quality of life, boost happiness levels and maximize visitor satisfaction.<br><br><br><br>

STRATEGY<br><br>
We are leading Dubai’s AI Roadmap as part of our vision to transform the city into an efficient, seamless, impactful and, ultimately, happy experience for all. Established in partnership with IBM, our AI Lab is working with a growing network of partners from across governmental and private sectors, providing the essential tools and go-to-market support that enables them to implement AI services and applications within their respective fields. We are expanding our knowledge through workshops and training sessions, developing individuals’ skills, transforming the way we engage with our citizens and visitors, and disrupting traditional business processes. We hope to infuse AI into the fabric of the city and its operating systems, and use this ground-breaking technology to discover new pathways to create a blueprint for a new and exciting future.<br><br><br><br>
