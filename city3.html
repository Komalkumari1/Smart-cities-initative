<p>In 2014, Copenhagen scooped the World Smart City Award for its "Connecting Copenhagen" Smart city development strategy. Initiatives are run out of the Copenhagen Solutions Lab, which is focusing on air quality data collection and traffic management.</p>

Copenhagen is the largest city in Denmark with about
600,000 inhabitants in its city area and almost 2 million in
its greater metropolitan area. The capital is generally considered to be highly advanced in regard to technology as
well as quality of life and in 2014 Copenhagen won the
prestigious World Smart Cities Award i<br><br><br><br><br>n Barcelona for the
concept, “Copenhagen Connecting”.
Copenhagen Connecting<br><br><br><br><br>
Copenhagen Connecting is a concept for a digital infrastructure across the entire city. The assumption behind the
concept is that digital infrastructure will be the future platform
for smart city innovation and will cover the city in a similar
way to physical infrastructure today. A business case states
a socio-economic potential in the order of 4.4 billion DKK,
if the concept is implemented11.<br><br><br><br><br>
Copenhagen Solutions Lab<br><br><br><br><br>
The Copenhagen Solutions Lab was initiated in late 2014
and spawned the Smart City Street Lab as a tool for citizen
involvement and development of business, by testing smart
city solutions in the area around City Hall12. The Street
Lab is a test bed for smart city solutions in Copenhagen to
showcase the newest technologies and catalyse partnerships
with the private sector and academia.<br><br><br><br><br>
Urban planning and carbon neutrality<br><br><br><br><br>
The municipality has focused its smart city initiatives on
environmental issues related to its commitment for Copenhagen to be an entirely carbon neutral city by 202513. The
socio-economic gain of the carbon neutral city will be a
least 1 billion DKK yearly from savings in the use of heating
and electricity14 . The adherence to the goal of carbon neutrality is evident in the urban development currently taking
place in Copenhagen. For instance, the design of the new
Nordhavn district of Copenhagen, which is currently being
built, took into account renewable energy supply forms and
green means of transportation. <br><br><br><br><br>In a helix partnership15, the
City of Copenhagen has established a Smart City Energy
Lab in Nordhavn. Over the next four years (2015-2019),
the Lab will develop and demonstrate future urban energy
solutions. The project utilizes Copenhagen’s Nordhavn as
a full-scale smart city energy lab and demonstrates
electricity, heating, energy-efficient buildings, and electric
transport can be integrated into an intelligent, flexible, and
optimized energy system16.

Open data<br><br><br><br><br>
Another priority for Copenhagen with regard to their smart
city strategy is the publishing of accessible and open data.
Through its open data portal, www.data.kk.dk, the municipality has published more than a hundred data sets, including
maps of parking spots, public toilets, and simulations of
traffic flow, for example.<br><br><br><br><br> A vast amount of future publications
of data are planned, such as energy statistics for the city’s
buildings and demographic data. In addition the potential
of ‘big data’ is being explored as the Japanese technology
company Hitachi is establishing a big data platform (City
Data Exchange) in the spring of 2015 in cooperation with
the City of Copenhagen, the Capital Region of Denmark
and CLEAN. The platform aims to bring together private
data and open public sector data to create better public
solutions and new business opportunities for companies17. <br><br><br><br><br>
