<h1>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</h1><br>
<p>The Amsterdam Smart City initiative began in 2009, and it currently includes over 170 projects being developed collaboratively by government, residents, and businesses. The projects run on wireless devices on an interconnected platform, and they enhance the city's real-time decision-making ability.<br><br><br><br><br>

The Amsterdam Smart City Initiative (ASC)<br><br>
Since its conception in 2009, the ASC has facilitated over 80 pilot projects aimed at making the city smarter. In one early programme, the Department of Research and Statistics went directly into individual government departments in the capital and access data directly.
Using statistics from insurance companies alongside information about the cost of treatment, they found that some areas with high levels of people with depression were not receiving proportionate levels of care. The city put further funds into an education programme aimed at those who were resisting treatment or did not want to acknowledge their disease — and increased the number receiving medical care.<br><br><br><br>
Plastic Free Rivers<br><br>
This pilot highlights the importance of not only collecting information but also organising and sharing it. In a recent Makathon for plastic-free rivers, designers Anne Marieke Eveleens, Saskia Studer and Francis Zoet used principles shared by the oil and dredging industries to create ‘The Great Bubble Barrier’. The simple idea places a tube with holes at the bottom of a river. By pumping air through this, you create a ‘bubble barrier’ that stops plastic floating in the river and guides waste to the banks for collection. For a city like Amsterdam, with a complex and open canal system, this is an invaluable innovation. The method is cheap and can be easily applied to other waterways across the world, providing a solution to the 8 million tons of plastic that are dumped into the ocean every year.<br><br><br><br>

Van Plestik has taken this solution one step further by gathering the waste plastic collected and transforming it into a building material for 3D printers. These printers can create high-quality and affordable plastic objects for a range of applications. Van Plestik is part of a scheme run by StartupAmsterdam called Startup in Residence.<br><br><br><br>
StartupAmsterdam<br><br>
A 2015 collaboration between the City of Amsterdam and 250 stakeholders in the tech sector. The aim was to unify and amplify the startup system in Amsterdam and build an ecosystem.<br><br><br><br>

The objective was to be a one stop shop for startups, connecting them to key players, mentors, investors, tech talent and launching customers. On their website, you can search job boards, find a co-working space, see an event calendar, read relevant news articles, check out university courses, join a network of communities including 80+ corporates and get support from liaison staff.
At Eli5 we have used the system to connect with smart city planners, test out our latest digital products, network with similar companies, find talent and then give back to the system by organising meetups and internships to share our methods and experiences with those just starting out in industry. For example, this year we wanted to beta-test our online proposal tool and quickly found freelancer groups who were willing to give us feedback. Then in exchange, we provided the software to them for free.<br><br><br><br>
In just two years, the project has solidified Amsterdam’s status as the centre of the EU tech scene. In a very short time they have:
Established a corporate network
Created Launchpad Meetups to connect corporates and startups
Initiated Amsterdam Capital Week to connect startups to capital
Launched startup academies including BSSA (B.Startup School Amsterdam) and the Growth Tribe Academy
Co-organised international startup bootcamps
Introduced coding classes into school curriculums<br><br><br><br>
Startup in Residence
One of the initiatives supported by StartupAmsterdam is Startup in Residence, a governmental incubator.
Each year, the municipality evaluate the concerns of the people and create a set of social challenges for startups to solve using city data. By doing this, they tap into the huge startup culture in Amsterdam and the talented application, platform and software developers they employ.<br><br><br><br>

With anywhere between 1500–2000 startups in Amsterdam at any one time, collaborating with creatives and developers speeds up the innovation process considerably. It also means that citizens can be directly involved in the future of their city.<br><br><br><br>
If the solutions prove successful, the City of Amsterdam will invest in the company or become their launching customers. Working with the municipality presents a unique opportunity for a startup to access the support of city experts and their network. The scheme has backed almost all of the apps mentioned in this article.<br><br><br><br>
The pilot scheme in 2015 produced five viable projects including an app that encourages residents to separate their waste and an app that helps to get visitors out of their hotels and accommodations and also spread tourists more evenly by providing information about Amsterdam’s lesser known attractions, called Wyzer.<br><br><br><br>
Wyzer App by Wander<br><br><br><br>
What is so smart about the app is that it helps to keep people off the beaten path, whilst improving their experience of the city. The app connects to a compass rather than a map, so you are still heading in the right direction, but can explore different routes to get there. They call this ‘fuzzy navigation’. The app highlights ‘hidden gems’ for you to discover along the way. So when you get home, you have a more unique story to tell than the majority of tourists — and the locals are happy with reduced congestion.
The tech uses map, GPS and tourism data, then relies on a bit of community collaboration to suggest the best places to recommend to users.<br><br><br><br>

The Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS)<br><br><br><br>
AMS was conceived by Delft University, Wageningen University and MIT in response to a call for proposals from the city to develop metropolitan solutions to practical urban issues. Launching an Institute means research and, more importantly, small-scale testing can be carried out. Relatively cheap applications and platforms can be made to validate ideas quickly and create viable real-time data and analytics.<br><br><br><br>
AMS is part of a project to move on from the conventional forms of public data used by apps like Wyzer and research ways to produce large-scale, geosocial data. This is mined from sensors, GPS devices and mobile phones. However, this information is more human-oriented and also benefits from previously untapped forms of community information from social media, LoRa networks and open data portals.<br><br><br><br>
In June 2016, the Netherlands became the first country in the world to have a nationwide LoRa network to facilitate the Internet of Things. Thus, it is the perfect Living Lab to test this new type of data.<br><br><br><br>
Benefits of Big Urban Data<br><br><br><br>
One of the most ambitious projects at AMS is the Social Urban Data Lab. Researchers and developers are building state of the art technology for the “acquisition, enrichment, integration, analysis and visualisation of big urban data”.<br><br><br><br>
If you can gather knowledge about the challenges and grievances in real-time and from a vast group of citizens, then urban planners and decision makers will be much better informed. Inevitably, this means the policy will serve the community more effectively and improve the quality of life.<br><br><br><br>
Social Glass<br><br><br><br>

One of the outcomes from the Social Urban Data Lab is Social Glass. This web-based platform utilises real-time urban big data analytics and forecasting to create a “reflection of the human landscape”.<br><br><br><br>
By analysing word meanings and the relationships between them with advanced lexical semantics and combining the results with machine learning, the team can determine the condition, mood, desires — almost any emotion — of the public.<br><br><br><br>
When you begin to cross reference this with geolocation data and other open data from the municipality, you can start to establish patterns and map the mood of the city. So if a local event is disturbing residents, ambient social data can help to direct planners to the problem. Or if a long museum queue is annoying tourists the platform can send alerts telling others to avoid the attraction until it is less busy.<br><br><br><br>
The science isn’t perfect. Social posts are diverse in character and content, lack structure and can be biased and ambiguous. It will take some time for the artificial intelligence to learn to recognise patterns and validate the data. But by further engaging citizens in the smart city initiative, Amsterdam has an advantage when it comes to the next step.<br><br><br><br>
Amsterdam says that its goal is to reduce traffic, save energy and improve public safety. It upgraded street lamps so that municipal councils can dim the lights based on pedestrian usage.<br><br><br><br><br>

A number of homes in Amsterdam have been provided smart energy meters, which incentivizes reducing energy consumption. Smart traffic sensors allow the city to alert drivers to current traffic conditions so they can decide on the best routes to take.</p><br><br><br><br>
