Smart City Initiative of Barcelona: An Integrated Urban Development Model<br><br><br><br><br>The urban transformation of Barcelona dates back to 1980s. It changed from being ina deep economic crisis and having a serious infrastructure deficit, to becoming aleading metropolis. Barcelona has distinctive characteristics that impact itsurbanisation plan. It has been highly urban, densely constructed, with very closecollaboration between politicians and companies . Marshall  concluded thatearlier urban planning of the city had been relatively weak; for instance, the period ofthe 1992 Olympics was mainly about internal infrastructure for urban planning<br><br><br><br><br>

Smart Districts<br><br><br><br><br>In
 certain districts, Barcelona has pushed the limits toward an effective and sustain-able city by transforming itself from an industrial area into a home of new innovativecompanies. This, specifically, is the 22@Barcelona district project, but that is just oneof many projects within the Barcelona Smart City plan. The 22@Barcelona has amodel of knowledge city that covers Smart City standards with economics, greeninfrastructure, inclusiveness, science and tech, housing, mobility, quality of life andidentity. The 22@Barcelona district supports a series of projects that will add value tocompanies and cities. Among these projects, Barcelona Urban Innovation Lab &Dev(BUILD) programme exists as a mixed sphere in the Smart City model development[2,5]. Based on the Smart City model, this programme aims to foster the participationof the private sector in the development of innovative products and services related toimprovements in the urban space management. This creates two types of relationshipsbetween the city council and organisations—urban research and urban lab.<br><br><br><br><br>
the Smart City initiative was necessary because there were obvious deficiencies in theprevious strategic planning regarding housing, environmental issues, water, transpor-tation and energy. To achieve a change in these areas while implementing the use ofICT, city hall recognised that a common action from all the elements of city wasrequired. This is why the city authorities together with the other organisations andinstitutions organised the Smart City strategic plan in 1990s with the aim of placingBarcelona in a leading position for being a Smart City across Europe.The conceptualization of the Smart City by Barcelona is quite extensive. <br><br><br><br>ForBarcelona, Smart City implies a high-tech intensive and an advanced city thatconnects people, information and city elements using new technologies in order tocreate a sustainable, greener city, competitive and innovative commerce and arecuperating life quality with a straightforward administration and a good mainte-nance system. More importantly, Smart City Barcelona is a collaborative movementamong its corporations (retail), academic institutions, government authorities and theresidents of Barcelona, aimed at becoming a reference programme for economicengines and urban development. Together, they are developing smart projects tofoster the competitive profile of city<br><br><br><br>.The general objective of the Smart City model in Barcelona is to use ICT in orderto transform the business processes of public administration both internally andexternally to be more accessible, efficient, effective and transparent. For instance,through providing Smart Services, Barcelona aims to boost cooperation between thecouncil, civil stratum and the professional arena.There are various drivers for the Smart City model in Barcelona, but among all,fostering competitiveness of the city is the leading one. Smart City was initiated topromote innovation, create new channels of communication, facilitate access toinformation both locally and internationally and improve the efficiency of publicservices.The Smart City initiative is just one part of an advanced conceptual model ofBarcelona (Fig. 1). Smart City is the physical environment that provides the infra-structure and town planning based on historical patrimony. A knowledge economy isbuilt with an industrial network and clusters in this physical area. This creates arelationship space, social network between companies, institutions and city hall andcitizens. This interaction of the citizens with this area and companies eventuallycreates a knowledge society.The main assets of Barcelona Smart City model are summarised in Fig. 2based onthe interviews with leading members of the Barcelona City Council.<br><br><br><br> These initiativesare grouped under four main topics: Smart Governance, Smart Economy, SmartLiving and Smart People. Other than tools such as kiosks and maps, Smart Gover-nance involves a major initiative such as Open Data. However, all mainly aim toprovide a better access to government information. Smart Economy involves thecreation of innovation clusters and a triple helix concept where companies, facultiesand citizens can interact and collaborate.<br><br><br><br> So that innovation can be fostered throughthese networks, the initiatives under Smart Living is mainly targeting new technologyadoptions that are mainly initiated by municipal police and tool developments forpublic transport. Finally, Smart People mainly involves training programmes fordigital literacy of the Barcelona City Hall. To support these initiatives, Barcelonahave built and/or use existing or new infrastructures—the 22@Barcelona innovationJ Knowl Econ (2013) <br><br><br><br>generate growing environments that should push a growing, sustainable and progressivedynamic. In this sense, cooperation between these actors seems to be the key for thedevelopment of a suitable environment for talent development.The Main Components of the Smart City Strategy of BarcelonaSmart DistrictsIn certain districts, Barcelona has pushed the limits toward an effective and sustain-able city by transforming itself from an industrial area into a home of new innovativecompanies. This, specifically, is the 22@Barcelona district project, but that is just oneof many projects within the Barcelona Smart City plan. The 22@Barcelona has amodel of knowledge city that covers Smart City standards with economics, greeninfrastructure, inclusiveness, science and tech, housing, mobility, quality of life andidentity. The 22@Barcelona district supports a series of projects that will add value tocompanies and cities. Among these projects, Barcelona Urban Innovation Lab &Dev(BUILD) programme exists as a mixed sphere in the Smart City model development[2,5]. Based on the Smart City model, this programme aims to foster the participationof the private sector in the development of innovative products and services related toimprovements in the urban space management. This creates two types of relationshipsbetween the city council and organisati.<br><br><br><br>
The 22@Barcelona district supports the formation of urban research and facilitatesa new working space among the Barcelona City Hall, companies and institutes. Thisspace is intended to foster research activities about the smart management of theurban space and e-Services. To achieve successful outcomes, the city council sup-ports this urban research through providing human resources and tools depending onthe subject, size and proposal relevance. Thus, the main objective is to sustain an areafor the collaboration with companies and institutes for new product developmentswhile improving the urban management.As a district, 22@Barcelona also creates a space of personal relationships. Itconstructs an affiliation sensation to the community of 22@Barcelona and this alsoencourages feelings such as pride to live and work in 22@Barcelona district. Todevelop and sustain this space, a number of programmes such as agora programme,relationship spaces and 22@Barcelona Network have been implemented by the cityhall for the professionals. For the residents in that district, other kinds of programmesused such as digital district programmes, support the initiatives of the district andactions of direct communication.<br><br><br><br>
Living Labs Initiatives<br><br><br><br>As mentioned above, 22@Barcelona, also referred as 22@Urban Lab, is anothercomponent of the BUILD programme. The BUILD programme uses 22@ district as aleading living lab for new infrastructures and services, inspiring companies to test anddevelop innovative solutions as products or services in any field: sensorization, urbanplanning, mobility, education, etc.Living labs are used as tools and processes for the creation of user innovationcooperatively in real-life environments. It is employed for learning, conducting testsand research for the implementation of new technologies and services of organisa-tions in large-scale real-life environments.<br><br><br><br> As a promising method, living labs notonly provide benefits like product improvements but also foster innovation and giveinsights for future markets while lowering risks. This is why living lab applicationshave been accelerated tremendously in the recent years across Europe. Other than22@Urban Lab, Barcelona has numerous living labs such as LIVE, BDigital CusterTIC Living Lab, i2Cat LivingLab (related to UPC), FABLab (linked to IAAC),HANGAR and CITILAB–CORNELLÀ.In the case of 22@Urban Lab, the experimentations of new products and servicesthat are at pre-commercial stages ease the market access for companies, whileboosting competitiveness in their sectors. Thus, 22@Urban Lab is used as a tool tobring the latest products and services closer to the city hall services. The districtalready has a collection of about 14 pilots in various domains such as environment,mobility and telecom. Projects in the neighbourhood began in 2001 and have run forover 10 years in the district.<br><br><br><br> It involves projects aimed at creating sustainable living,working and mobility with advanced infrastructures. Some pilots include the imple-mentation of 12 outdoor public street-lighting points, Eco Digital with LED technol-ogy that includes sensors of vibration, temperature, humidity, sound and pollution aswell as GSM aerials, Wi-Fi Mesh access point and webcams for video surveillancefunctions. Another trial was about the implementation of charging points for electriccars and the management and analysis of the system from a centralised control point.
in Barcelona City Council. This district embraces clusters of ICT, media, energy,design and biomedical with a triple helix case [2,5]. Here, new business culture ispromoted based on collaboration between companies, universities and the publicsector for innovation (Fig. 3).<br><br><br><br>Infrastructures<br><br><br><br>Since the 1990s, Barcelona has been planning and investing in order to be a leadingmetropolitan city and to achieve that it has been building new motorways, trainservices and infrastructures. <br><br><br><br>Defining Barcelona’s future as a Smart City, the govern-ment has embarked on a massive model to build up the necessary infrastructure.However, the aim is not just evolving Barcelona from its strong industrial legacy to aproductive and profitable knowledge-based economy but an improvement of thequality of life for its citizens. It would also allow better delivery of public servicesfrom transportation to education and healthcare.To achieve the objectives of the Smart City model, the traditional infrastructuresare redesigned to ease the integration of ICT at all levels. This can take placeeither as a minor road renewal or a whole transformation of a major district suchas 22@Barcelona or Sagrera for a model of territory adaption to the new needs.This major transformation involves infrastructures such as companies, institutions,specific spaces, universities, technological centres, incubators, residences, dissem-ination, entrepreneurs and other services. The backbone of the Smart City involvesspecial public property infrastructure plans. <br><br><br><br>This involves Wi-Fi and optic fibre, anew mobility plan, new heating and cooling systems, new energy networks andunderground galleries. For instance, the communication infrastructure optical fibreproject was initiated in 1994, and today, it covers 325 km for the development ofcity services <br><br><br><br>
New Services for the Citizen<br><br><br><br>The Smart City model of Barcelona provides various new services: a corporate fibreoptical network to connect the main municipal buildings; a Wi-Fi mesh network toprovide wireless connection to those municipal services and employees working atstreet level; sensor networks to manage a multivendor, multipurpose sensors networkconfigured to be used by several providers; and a public Wi-Fi network.The foremost result of the Smart City model in Barcelona, Smart Services, isgrouped according to the target and producer.<br><br><br><br> The first one is the internal governmentservices. These services aim at making public workers’tasks easier and giving usefulinformation to city managers that can help them take better management decisionsand evaluate policies. These services boost the cooperation between the several strataof public workers in order to acquire efficiency and efficacy.Secondly, there are services aimed at making the citizens’daily life easierand more comfortable, by offering more and better services, offering updatedinformation in a proactive way and fostering citizens’participation in the citymanagement daily life.<br><br><br><br> These are grouped under government to Citizen/Busi-ness services.Finally, services created by citizens for the citizens, including also the professionalarena, boosting cooperation between the several elements of civil life are groupedunder Citizen to Citizen services. These services are based on public Open Data,representing the real social innovation and the real openness of a city.<br><br><br><br>Open Data<br><br><br><br>Recently, the Barcelona City Hall became involved in the Open Data movement withthe Open Data project, whose objective is the opening up of government informationto public access. These data involve territory, population, management and procedureindicators, urban environment and documental data. It is society’s right to use thisdata, whether to brief themselves or for creating new services, increasing social valueand perhaps also commercial value. The underlying objectives for the Open Datainitiative are as follows: (1) design and validate a network management platform andsensor data that can become a reference for other cities, (2) create a communicationsnetwork of sensors that allows communication between many of the sensors devel-oped across Catalonia, (3) identify a framework based on open standards, (4) developa platform that is completely applicable for any city of any size and (5) explore andimplement the appropriate services for public management enhancement [5].<br><br><br><br>Management of Smart City<br><br><br><br> InitiativeIn order to achieve the objectives of the Open Data initiative, Barcelona CityHall has to take certain actions. First, it needs to develop the platform ofnetwork management and sensor data while considering that the system shouldallow the integration of other types of communications at the network levelsensor. Secondly, a development of a proof of concept of the platform with thedeployment of the developed systems is needed that will interact with theexisting sensor infrastructure as well as new ones.144 J Knowl Econ (2013) <br><br><br><br>
Eventually, all these initiatives and projects for Smart City model aim to fosterinnovation and increase the efficiency of public services while providing moreinformation access and communication channels.Accordingly, the management of the Barcelona Smart City initiative is composedof various organisations and departments. These mainly involve the 22@Barcelonaagency which was responsible for urban planning, setting up new infrastructures andrefurbishing pre-existent ones.<br><br><br><br> Together with the 22@Barcelona agency, PromocióEconòmica (Economic Promotion) was responsible for attracting economic capital tothe region. There are two governmental departments that are also involved in themanagement of Barcelona Smart City model. These are the mobility department, thatis responsible for the mobility plan of public and private transport, and the control andenvironment department that is in charge of environmental issues. Finally, InstitutMunicipal d’Informàtica (Municipal Institute of Information Technologies) that pro-vides IT services to the city hall is also involved in the management process. Thus, allthese organisations work and collaborate together in order to run the Smart Citymodel successfully in Barcelona.<br><br><br><br>
