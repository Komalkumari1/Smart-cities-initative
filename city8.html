<p>Schenectady is upgrading its 4,400 street lights to LED technology. This will allow the lights to be dimmed during off-hours or adjusted based on real-time data. The city is also planning on using the light poles to house 5G small-cell antennas.The city’s wi-fi data network and a new software program called Municity5 will allow building inspectors to file reports and print documents from the field. City police will also be able to use the network to upload dashboard video from their patrol cars without having to return to the police station.<br><br><br><br><br><img src="img/k6.jpg" height="400" weight="400"><br><br><br><br><br>
The city of Schenectady, New York is moving ahead with its Smart City initiative. Mayor Gary McCarthy created the Mayoral Smart City commission to take advantage of new technology for superior delivery of government services and improved quality of life.<br><br><br>

“The future of government infrastructure is more than pipes and pavement; it is building a cohesive wireless network and utilizing sustainable technology to lower the burden on residents through more efficient services, while also improving their quality of life,” said McCarthy. “This team of experienced and impressive individuals will aid in promoting growth and development in all areas of Schenectady and help the City continue to be a leader in solving urban problems.”<br><br><br>
Routing and Fleet Management<br><br><br>
Following the adoption of the 2015 Budget, the City Administration began the process of researching various options to utilize GPS tracking and fleet management software. The proposed solution involved software and routing analytics from Transfinder as well as a GPS tracking system and preventative maintenance analytics from Zonar. The resulting project utilizes electronic record keeping for City vehicle maintenance and status updates, real time diagnostic information and intelligent and responsive routing. When used together, these tools have allowed the City to form a baseline to cut future costs of fuel use, vehicle maintenance expenditures and unnecessary miles driven.<br><br><br>
Smart City, Smart Buildings<br><br><br>
City of Schenectady staff members are taking steps to learn about smart technology in all of its various forms, including smart buildings. We are currently taking part in the Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC).

The GCTC program is a platform designed for collaboration and the creation of smart cities and communities. This program is led by several different agencies:<br><br><br>

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br><br><br>
U.S. Department of Commerce<br><br><br>
U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T)<br><br><br>
National Science Foundation<br><br><br>
International Trade Administration<br><br><br>
National Telecommunications and Information Administration. <br><br><br>
Interested parties have begun to create “action clusters” and “SuperClusters” dedicated to various topics that help make cities smarter, while contributing to work on Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications.<br><br><br>

Interactive Parking Regulation Map<br><br><br>
Welcome to the City of Schenectady's interactive Parking Regulation Map!
Please Note:

While this map does not include every restriction in the city, it does provide an overview of the main parking regulations on streets that are used for snow plowing and street sweeping.

There are no accuracy guarantees provided with this map, as parking regulations are always subject to change.

Parking enforcement is provided based on the posted signage and/or current conditions on a street.
Transportation and Roadways

Working with Transfinder, a local global logistics software company, the city is using software and GPS tracking to identify more efficient potential routes for garbage trucks and snow plows. Schenectady can then utilize the data received to determine preventative maintenance scheduling to reduce maintenance costs and aid in more efficient fleet management. The software is also used to gather reports to track information such as fuel consumption, operating costs and employee concerns to identify needs in the fleet.
<br><br><br>
Utility and Parking Management
<br><br><br>
The city operates a computerized traffic control system that provides maintenance reports for 60 traffic lights. Parking kiosks that accept credit cards and generate maintenance reports on their current condition are currently utilized in many areas of the city.<br><br><br>

Infrastructure
<br><br><br>
Installing more energy efficient street-lighting is estimated to reduce the city’s lighting bill by a third. Future plans call for the installation of WiFi transmitters, cameras and environmental sensors that could help the city operate more efficiently.
